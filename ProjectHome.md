# RallyeTime System #
This website is the repository for my work on my TSD road rally system. All the current code and past versions of the system are available for download.

A Rally is a time-speed-distance event you run in your car with a team of two people on public roads. You have to travel an unknown path by following a set of directions and arrive at the checkpoint at exactly the right time based off the speed limit of the roads you were travelling.

I'm currently developing a new system, but you can view the version of this system I developed and used to  win the 2008 Fall [TAMSCC](http://tamscc.org) rally season.

You can read about [the existing system here](http://code.google.com/p/rallyetime/wiki/RallyeTimeDG).

## Current Plans ##
Currently I'm designing a new system that will be used for both tour and course SCCA style rallies. I plan on developing a proving its useful over the 2009 WDCR SCCA Rally season. The goal is to develop a system that is cheaper, easier to use, and better than traditional 'A' box rally computers. The software program will be free for anyone to use and I plan on developing and offering for sale the needed hardware portion.

I will posting [to the project blog](http://rallyetime.blogspot.com/) about my progress as I develop the prototype system.
