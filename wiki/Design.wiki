#summary RallyeTime DG design
#labels Featured,Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Some guiding principles in designing the code for this project:
  * Must be completly realtime, no blocking for I/O or read operations
  * Multithreaded, seperate threads for each main task of the system
  * Easy to use, must be simple and quick to start up and initialize
  * Gracefully handle errors, including loss of GPS signal
  * Use common libraries, including Boost Threads

== Components ==

Different hardware components making up the system:
  * *Laptop*, runs everything
  * *Buttons*, external buttons mounted next to shifter, for next, checkpoint, undo, panic, used during the rallye
  * *LCD*, external 20x4 LCD display mounted on gauge cluster, used to display
  * *Audio*, laptop audio out going through the car stereo to read directions out loud
  * *DAQ*, interface everything with the laptop, including reading the VSS signal through the counter
  * *Laptop mount*, mount all loose electronics and laptop


= Details =

Different sections of the program:
  * Calculation, based on current time and distance, 
  * Read DAQ, read in button status, wheel sensor counter
  * Write DAQ, output LCD screen, reset button flipflop
  * GPS, get gps update if available

Different threads will be, calculation, DAQ communication, GPS reading, log data.
